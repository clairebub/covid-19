Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli sings an Easter Sunday concert in an empty Duomo di Milano, joined by his organist. The concert is titled “Andrea Bocelli: Music for Hope”. 

“Thanks to music, streamed live, bringing together millions of clasped hands everywhere in the world, we will hug this wounded Earth’s pulsing heart, this wonderful international forge that is reason for Italian pride,” Bocelli says, over drone footage of a vacant-looking Milan. The livestream was watched by millions on that day. If you missed the livestream, don’t worry. Bocelli’s concert are available now on YouTube.
